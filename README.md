In this project I have used survival analysis to study how the likelihood of the customer churn changes over time. I have also implementd a Random Forest model to predict the customer churn and deployed a model using flask webapp on Heroku. [App](https://churn-prediction-app.herokuapp.com/)
Segmentation and affinity analysis are also done to study user purchase patterns.

<br />

### 4. Causal Inference and A/B Test

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://ck-obsidian.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/20240812164954.png"> **[Interactive Ads and User Conversion Rates: An A/B Test](https://github.com/archd3sai/News-Articles-Recommendation)**

A hybrid-filtering personalized news articles recommendation system which can suggest articles from popular news service providers based on reading history of twitter users who share similar interests (Collaborative filtering) and content similarity of the article and user’s tweets (Content-based filtering).

<br />

### 5. Data Modeling

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://ck-obsidian.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/20240812164338.png">  **[Weather the Storm: Mastering Insurance &amp; Site Selection](https://github.com/archd3sai/News-Articles-Recommendation)**

全球各地极端气候不断增多，保险公司对极端气候地区房产承保风险变大，面临是否要减少承保的决策。我们通过ARIMA预测极端天气，利用EWM-TOPSIS评估保险风险，并提出地标保护建议，帮助保险公司决策及业主评估选址，优化风险管理与决策。


<br />

### 6. Other Capstone Projects

`<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/archd3sai/Portfolio/blob/master/Images/airplane.jpeg">` **[Predictive Maintenance of Aircraft Engine](https://github.com/archd3sai/Predictive-Maintenance-of-Aircraft-Engine)**

In this project I have used models such as RNN, LSTM, 1D-CNN to predict the engine failure 50 cycles ahead of its time, and calculated feature importance from them using sensitivity analysis and shap values. Exponential degradation and similarity-based models are also used to calculate its remaining life.

<br />

## III. Product Management

`<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/archd3sai/Portfolio/blob/master/Images/960x0.jpg">` **[PropriskAI - One-Stop Real Estate Risk Informa Service](https://github.com/archd3sai/Wind-Turbine-Power-Curve-Estimation)**

近期某些房地产公司发生债券违约事件，爆发了流动性危机，上游供应商的应收账款也会面临账期延长，但是风险信息的分散和难以获得可能极大影响下游供应商和投资者的风险决策。我们利用AI数据挖掘以及随机森林、XGBoost和神经网络等机器学习算法，解决信息分散、非结构化的问题，自主构建数据集并提出客观评估房地产企业流动性危机影响范围和规模的模型和方法，搭建了一站式房地产风险全视域AI——PropriskAI。
